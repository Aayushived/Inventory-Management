# Inventory Management

Problem Statement:

Managing inventory can be a daunting and time-consuming task for manufacturing companies. Traditionally, inventory data is manually entered into books or stored on local computers. This method is not only slow but also prone to human error, leading to discrepancies in stock levels and inaccurate reporting. Moreover, it lacks the flexibility to track inventory across multiple locations or provide real-time visibility, making it difficult to manage unsold stock efficiently. These challenges can result in poor decision-making, overstocking, or missed sales opportunities.

Solution:

This project solves these inventory management issues by leveraging Google Sheets (Apps Script) to automate data entry and reporting. By moving the entire process to the cloud, this solution simplifies inventory tracking and ensures real-time updates, accessibility from any location, and automated notifications for unsold products.

Key Features:
- Cloud-Based Inventory Tracking:
Transition from manual, offline data entry to a centralized, cloud-based inventory system using Google Sheets. This ensures your data is always up to date and accessible from anywhere.

- User-Friendly Interface:
The interface is designed for simplicity, allowing team members to easily enter data without needing specialized training. Google Sheets provides an intuitive platform that everyone is familiar with.

- Automated Weekly Notifications:
Stay on top of unsold inventory with weekly email notifications. This feature automatically alerts you about slow-moving stock, helping you make timely decisions about restocking or promotions.

Results:

By implementing this cloud-based automation, companies can improve inventory accuracy, and enhance overall operational efficiency. This solution not only saves time but also empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions with confidence.
