# Inventory Management

Problem
Managing inventory can be a daunting and time-consuming task for manufacturing companies. Traditionally, inventory data is manually entered into books or stored on local computers. This method is not only slow but also prone to human error, leading to discrepancies in stock levels and inaccurate reporting. Moreover, it lacks the flexibility to track inventory across multiple locations or provide real-time visibility, making it difficult to manage unsold stock efficiently. These challenges can result in poor decision-making, overstocking, or missed sales opportunities.
